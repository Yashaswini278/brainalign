my grandfather was harry truman and he is known for a great many things but the one that always comes up and the one that usually comes up first is his decision to use atomic weapons against japan in nineteen forty five my grandfather never spoke to me about that decision to be fair i probably didn't give him a chance you had to be careful around my grandfather he would give you a history lesson if he could catch you i learned about hiroshima and nagasaki the same way that all of you did from a history book and my history book did not have a whole lot it it has to cover a lot so there was a page a page and a half there was explanation there were casualty figures there was usually a picture of the mushroom cloud but there wasn't much or anything at all about what happened to the people on the ground in nineteen ninety four three things happened i was thirty seven years old the first thing was that i agreed to join the board of the harry s truman library in independence missouri i had not up to that point taken an active role in my grandfather's legacy i was married i had started a family i was working as a newspaper reporter in wilmington north carolina but my mother margaret truman had gotten older and had felt that it was time to pass the baton to have the next generation come in at about this time my editor on the newspaper said there is a japanese exchange student in town she is going to give a demonstration of ikebana japanese flower arranging go out interview her i need a story for tomorrow's paper so i met the young woman and her host who was an older guy who lived in town i knew him and at the end of the interview he her host said to me i told her who your grandfather was and she smiled and bowed and said that's very nice and i said thanks and in the next second he said to her tell him about your grandfather and she looked very uncomfortable she stared at the floor and when she didn't answer he said to me her grandfather was killed in hiroshima i said to her the only thing that i think one human being can say to another in a case like that i said i am so sorry i am so sorry you lost your grandfather but what she did surprised me she looked me in the eyes and smiled and said thank you and in that brief instant i thought that both of us wanted to walk over there and knock her host on his butt for putting us in that situation the third thing that happened actually happened three days earlier my mother margaret truman had agreed to give the keynote address at ceremonies in wilmington marking the fiftieth anniversary of the d day landings at normandy and as we were all leaving the theater at the end of the show a big crowd of us going out two older men were trying to get my mother's attention they were reaching for her sleeve and they missed my mother was whisked out the door with the crowd put in a car and driven back to her hotel my wife and i were behind her so we turned to these two gentlemen and asked if we if there was anything we could do and we noticed that both of them had tears in their eyes and we said what's wrong and they said nothing nothing we just wanted to thank her if it hadn't been for her father dropping that bomb neither one of us would be alive they were pacific war veterans five years later we are now living in chicago we moved to chicago and my son wesley who is now twenty five years old he was ten years old at the time he came home from school with a book sadako and the thousand paper cranes for those of you who don't know the story sadako sasaki was a real little girl she lived in hiroshima she was two years old when the bomb exploded she and her family survived but sadako was diagnosed nine years later with radiation induced leukemia to help her treatment she followed a japanese tradition that says if you fold a thousand origami paper cranes you are granted a wish or a long life or health there are several interpretations the most popular version of this story has her folding six hundred and forty four cranes her family says that she actually folded closer to fifteen hundred spiritually it was a great help to her but sadly she died of leukemia in october of nineteen fifty five there is a monument to sadako and to all the children killed wounded sickened by the bomb that stands in hiroshima's peace memorial park to this day thinking of the japanese exchange student and thinking of the two pacific war veterans i told wesley that i was glad he was reading this book because he needed to understand both his great grandfather's decision but also understand what that cost the japanese people his teacher didn't stop with the book she she taught them japanese history she taught them culture she taught them geography i came home one afternoon and found my my living room coffee table covered with sushi and green tea and wesley standing next to it wearing a kimono he brought all of japan into our lives he brought the country the culture everything into our household and i mentioned this over the next four or five years i mentioned this to a couple of different japanese journalists who were working on stories on the anniversaries of the bombings and one day my phone rang it was from a call from japan it was masahiro sasaki sadako's older brother himself a survivor of hiroshima and he said he'd heard that i had read his sister's story and he would like to meet me someday we met in new york in twenty ten where masahiro and his son yuji were donating one of sadako's last folded cranes to the world trade center memorial as a gesture of healing and during that meeting yuji sasaki produced a small box and took out of it a tiny paper crane and put it in my palm and he said that's the last one sadako folded before she died will you come to hiroshima and nagasaki for the memorial ceremonies and i said yes we arrived in tokyo in twenty twelve in august of twenty twelve and the train ride from narita airport into tokyo proper is about an hour and my family and i i took my wife and my two sons wesley and gates we all had our faces shoved up against the windows of the train because all this time the last two years we had been we had been soaking up japan we had been soaking up the culture the food we had been watching one miyazaki movie after another and here it all was on the outside of the train villages houses rice fields mountains forests of bamboo we were in japan we were there for a very somber purpose but we loved being there we we had sushi and sake and went to bed happy that night and the next morning i had my first interview with nhk the nation's largest television network and the young lady who interviewed me started off with a couple of intro questions she said how was your flight how do you like tokyo and the third question was are you here to apologize and i said with respect no and she said well then why did you bother coming and i all of the advance publicity for this trip had been positive japanese reporters had come to my home in chicago and interviewed me and turned in upbeat stories this looked like it was going to be very well accepted so this question caught me flat footed i i stammered through it i said it's not about apology it's about reconciliation it's about honoring the dead and listening to the living and i she didn't like any answer i gave her she rephrased the question over and over and over again digging for a different answer and it finally got so uncomfortable that my interpreter almost stopped the interview and that afternoon on the train to hiroshima i thought god what have i done what what have i gotten myself into i am not a representative of the united states i am a private citizen i i cannot apologize for my grandfather i cannot apologize for my country i've held sadako's crane in one hand and i have held in my other hand the hands of men who fought a horrible and bloody war what's gonna happen when i keep saying no how is this going to af is this whole thing just gonna be a bust and i worried about it all night in hiroshima i practiced that answer over and over again so at least i wouldn't fumble through it at least i would be succinct i didn't sleep much we got up the next morning and went into the peace park and there around the base of sadako's statue around the children's peace memorial were thirty or forty reporters cameras microphones and i thought here we go and i i braced myself t to just you know to spend the next week answering apology questions and out of the middle of this throng came masahiro sasaki and he walked up to me i hadn't seen him for two years since the first time we met and he walked up to me and he smiled and he put his arms around me and hugged me and my worries vanished because we were going to do this together we did everything together after that and masahiro answered the apology question for me he always he always got in front of that and what he essentially said was if we ask them for an apology for hiroshima and nagasaki they can ask us for one for pearl harbor and where do we go from there the survivors themselves and we interviewed masahiro and i sat down with more than two dozen survivors and just let them tell me their stories and it's hard it's hard to describe and it's hard to imagine what they went through burned the skin stripped from their arms and legs their houses destroyed their children trapped in the rubble burning to death because they couldn't get them out people vanished in an instant vaporized yet none of them none of them asked me for an apology none of them came to me in anger none came with recrimination they only asked that i listen sakue shimohira who survived nagasaki said i think the basic idea of peace is to have some understanding of other people's pain she and the other survivors asked only that i listen to them and i tell their stories to you to anyone else who will listen so that every one of us understands what it's like to live through a nuclear explosion so that hopefully we never ever do this to each other again
